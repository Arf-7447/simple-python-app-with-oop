# Simple Python App with OOP

## Overview

This repository contains a simple Python application that demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts by calculating the volumes of various geometric shapes. The application allows users to choose from different shapes and input their dimensions to calculate the volume.

## Features

- Calculates the volume of the following shapes:
  - Cylinder
  - Sphere
  - Rectangular Prism
  - Cube
  - Cone
- Provides a user-friendly menu to select the shape and input dimensions.
- Implements OOP principles with separate classes for each geometric shape.
- Uses modular code with separate files for the main logic and shape definitions.
- Clear and formatted output for easy readability.
- Exit option to terminate the program gracefully.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This application is compatible with Python 3.x.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd simple-python-app-with-oop
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to select a shape and input dimensions.
3. View the calculated volume for the selected shape.
4. Use the exit option to terminate the program.
